This is a website that allows dog owners in Wellington, NZ to find nearby parks that are suitable for their dogs.
It offers a search functionality where you can refine the parks to must be off road, or must be off leash,
as well as providing other information on the park. It also allows users to rate, and comment nearby parks.

This is hosted on MongoDB, which hosts the API and the Website, and is run on local port 8080. 
It utilises:
